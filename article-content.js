const initialArticleContent = "While Swiss people seem more optimistic than in the spring, they are also increasingly divided on sensitive issues, particularly vaccination, according to a new survey published on Friday by the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SSR), which highlights the fear of growing polarization in society.Rising spirits, renewed confidence in the authorities and the future, but significant division over the vaccine and a decline in the sense of solidarity: these are the main findings of the eighth survey on the crisis, conducted by Sotomo on behalf of the SSR (see methodology in the box). A highly divisive vaccine. Since the last survey in March, the vaccination campaign has made significant progress. In total, 60% of respondents have now received at least one dose. As a result, only 2% of Swiss people are now ready to be vaccinated as soon as possible, while 12% prefer to wait and 25.5% are convinced they do not want to receive an injection. While no significant differences are noted in the linguistic regions or between men and women, there is a clear divide in other categories. For instance, in the countryside, the proportion of vaccine refusals is nearly 30%, compared to only 16% in large cities. Unsurprisingly, the difference is also marked in age groups, as less than 10% of those aged 65 and over will refuse the shot, compared to nearly 30% for those aged 15-24, and even 31% among those aged 35-44.Similarly, among Swiss political parties, more than half of the supporters of the Swiss People's Party (UDC) reject the injection, whereas this rate drops to 14.5% among the Greens, 11.5% among The Centre, 11% among the Free Democratic Party (FDP.The Liberals), 7.5% among the Green Liberals, and even 7% among the Social Democrats (Socialist Party), which also has the highest percentage of vaccinated individuals at 81.5%. Fear of mRNA above all. To explain their refusal, the respondents primarily (72%) cite the fact that mRNA vaccines (those from Pfizer/Biontech and Moderna) have not been sufficiently tested. This is followed by the fear of side effects (47%), fundamental opposition to vaccination (31%), lack of personal interest (1%), and the desire to first allow at-risk individuals to be vaccinated (17%).Regarding mandatory vaccination for healthcare personnel, opinions are also divided, with nearly 45.8% of respondents being in favor or somewhat in favor, and 49.6% opposed or somewhat opposed. It should also be noted that the implementation of the Covid certificate receives 61% support, compared to 35% opposition and 4% neutral opinions. Among the most frequently cited arguments against this measure is the perception of a disguised vaccination mandate.Polarization of society. The economic future seems more optimistic than before. Thus, the number of people fearing job loss has decreased from 22% at the height of the crisis to 14% now. Similarly, while 37% of respondents feared financial losses in June 2020, only 23% do now. Conversely, 24% of respondents highlight the risk of conflict in the private sphere, compared to 10% at the beginning of the crisis, indicating a deterioration in relationships.Less solidarity, more selfishness...During the first wave in the spring of 2020, a majority of the population reported experiencing friendly and supportive interpersonal interactions. However, from the beginning of the second wave last autumn, this sentiment has shifted towards increased mistrust, selfishness, and aggressiveness. According to the survey institute, a crisis generates positive energies in the short term, but the longer it lasts, the more it depletes resources and increases the potential for conflict. Thus, in the summer of 2021, respondents perceive less solidarity (33% compared to 61% at the beginning of the crisis) and more selfishness (38% compared to 26% in April 2020). Disinterest (18% compared to 10%) and mistrust (35% compared to 24%) have also increased.... but spirits are rising and trust is returningThese rather negative sentiments do not prevent respondents from showing better spirits than in March, when morale was at its lowest since the beginning of the crisis. While it has not yet reached the pre-pandemic level, it is now above the average of the past year, especially in the 65 and over category, who feel noticeably better than the 15-34 year olds. These renewed spirits are also reflected in the trust in the Federal Council (the executive body of the Swiss government), which is gradually increasing. While the government's actions had gained widespread support during the first wave, peaking at 67% in April 2020, the situation deteriorated with the arrival of the second wave, reaching a low of 32.5% in January this year. Now, more than 54% of respondents express a high or very high level of trust in the Federal Council.Beyond the divisive issue of the vaccine and the certificate, the survey reveals the fear that this pandemic is leading to an increasing polarization of society. This is, in any case, the fourth most frequently cited consequence (59%) by the respondents, behind the increase in teleworking (78%), the rise of digitalization and innovation (64%), and the decline in business travel (60%).MethodThe survey was conducted from July 1 to July 5, 2021, by the Sotomo research center on behalf of the SSR. A total of 23,337 questionnaires completed by people over the age of 15 from all over Switzerland were evaluated for this purpose. The margin of error is +/- 1.3 percentage points.";
